"""How stale is the stored jackpot, and is that bad enough to shout about.

This module exists because of a real 18-day silence. On 2026-08-25 vietlott.vn began
answering GitHub Actions runners with a Cloudflare managed challenge, `_refresh_prizes`
caught the 403 exactly as designed, printed a yellow line nobody reads and kept the old
figure - and every run stayed green. The site never lied, but nothing ever said the
number had stopped moving either.

So the contract under test: one missed draw is a transient and must stay quiet; two or
more is a dead source and must be loud.
