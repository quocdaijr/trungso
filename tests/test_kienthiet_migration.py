"""XSMB is now a view over the Miền Bắc boards. These tests pin that nothing moved.

`data/xsmb.jsonl` holds 21 years of two-digit tails from a different upstream
(khiemdoan/vietnam-lottery-xsmb-analysis). `data/boards/mb.jsonl` holds the same draws
as full printed numbers from minhngoc. Two independent sources, one shared past: if the
tails derived from the boards do not reproduce the legacy file row for row, one of them
is wrong and the migration must not land.

The offline test is the gate and runs against whatever is committed. The network test
spot-checks live minhngoc against the legacy file and is opt-in via
TRUNGSO_NETWORK_TESTS=1, because CI must not depend on someone else's uptime.
