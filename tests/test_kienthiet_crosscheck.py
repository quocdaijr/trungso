"""Why minhngoc is the source and t-k-minh/XSMienNam-Analysis is not.

The obvious move for a Vietnamese lottery dataset is the GitHub mirror everybody links to,
which is how XSMB got into this repo in the first place. For the southern boards that
mirror is lossy in a way that is invisible unless you compare: its CSV has four columns
for giải tư, and giải tư has **seven** numbers. Every draw silently loses three.

This test is the evidence for that choice, and the alarm if it ever changes: if the mirror
grows the missing columns, the diff below stops being exactly three giải-tư numbers and
this fails - at which point the mirror is worth reconsidering.

Network-gated, because CI must not depend on someone else's uptime.
