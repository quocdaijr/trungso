"""The colophon quotes a line count and a test count, and both READMEs wear a test badge.

All of them were measured, so all of them rot the moment the code changes - and a stale
number on a site whose entire premise is that no number lies would be the worst bug in the
repo. These tests make them impossible to leave behind.

The badge is here because it proved the point: it sat at 459 while the suite passed 570,
silently, for 111 tests. The footer never drifted, because the footer had a test.
